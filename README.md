# 🔢 Challenge 3: Three Equal Cards (Bootstrap 5)
This mini project is part of my Bootstrap learning journey. The goal was to build a responsive 3-column card layout using Bootstrap’s grid system, container, and card components — without writing custom CSS.
## 🚀 What I Built
A clean, responsive section displaying **three equal-width cards** for:
- 💻 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- ⚙️ Bootstrap

Each card is wrapped inside a Bootstrap column (`col-md-4`) and styled using:
- `.card`
- `.shadow-sm`
- `.p-3`
- `.display-6` for headings

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to properly structure content using `container`, `row`, and `col`
- Wrapping cards inside Bootstrap columns to control layout
- Using utility classes like `shadow-sm`, `p-3`, `mt-5`, and `text-center`
- Understanding layout stacking across screen sizes (responsive design)
